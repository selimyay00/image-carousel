The React Image Slider employs a state variable named currentImage to keep track of the currently displayed image index. 

The logic for moving to the next slide involves checking if the current image is the last one in the array. If it is, the slider wraps around to the first image; otherwise, it increments to the next image in the array. Similarly, when moving to the previous slide, the logic ensures that if the current image is the first one, it wraps around to the last image; otherwise, it decrements to the previous image in the array. 

This navigation system allows for a seamless transition between images in both directions, creating a continuous slideshow experience.
